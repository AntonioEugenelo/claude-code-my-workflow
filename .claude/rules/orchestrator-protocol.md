# Orchestrator Protocol: Contractor Mode

**After a plan is approved, the orchestrator takes over autonomously.**

## The Loop

```
Plan approved → orchestrator activates
  │
  Step 1: IMPLEMENT — Execute plan steps
  │
  Step 2: VERIFY — Compile, render, check outputs
  │         If verification fails → fix → re-verify
  │
  Step 3: REVIEW
  │   3.0  Check .claude/active-infrastructure.md
  │         If manifest exists → only invoke listed agents + core (proofreader)
  │         If no manifest (main branch) → use full agent-routing table
  │   3.1  Select agents per agent-routing.md (document type → agent set)
  │   3.2  Run agents (parallel where allowed, sequential where required)
  │
  Step 4: FIX — Apply fixes (critical → major → minor)
  │
  Step 5: RE-VERIFY — Confirm fixes are clean
  │
  Step 6: SCORE — Apply quality-gates.md rubric
  │
  └── Score >= threshold?
        YES → Present summary to user
        NO  → Loop back to Step 3 (max 5 rounds)
              After max rounds → present with remaining issues
```

## Limits

- **Main loop:** max 5 review-fix rounds
- **Critic-fixer sub-loop:** max 5 rounds
- **Verification retries:** max 2 attempts
- Never loop indefinitely

## "Just Do It" Mode

When user says "just do it" / "handle it":
- Skip final approval pause
- Auto-commit if score >= commit threshold (see quality-gates.md)
- Still run the full verify-review-fix loop
- Still present the summary
