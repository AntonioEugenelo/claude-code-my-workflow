Optimal Monetary and Fiscal Policies in Disaggregated Economies

ABSTRACT
The jointly optimal monetary and fiscal policy mix in a multi-sector New Keynesian model with 
sectoral government spending and productivity shocks entails a separation of roles: Sectoral 
government spending optimally adjusts to sectoral output gaps and inflation rates---a policy 
supported by evidence from sectoral federal procurement data. Monetary policy optimally focuses 
on aggregate stabilization, but deviates from a zero-inflation target; in a model calibration to the 
U.S., however, it effectively approximates a zero-inflation target.  Because monetary policy is a 
blunt instrument and government spending trades off stabilization against the optimal-level public 
good provision, the first best is not achieved.

Introduction
Business cycle ﬂuctuations are not perfectly synchronized across sectors. Sectors
may be hit differently by shocks, as the COVID-19 pandemic so forcefully illus-
trated (Guerrieri et al., 2022; Baqaee and Farhi, 2022), or they have distinct charac-
teristics that determine their responsiveness even to identical shocks.1 These fea-
tures raise challenges for stabilization policy. If productivity shocks are perfectly
correlated across and propagate in the same way in all sectors, a zero-inﬂation
policy attains the ﬁrst best by closing the output gap; the so-called “divine coin-
cidence.” But when these conditions are not met, monetary policy is too blunt of
a tool. Then, central banks must target a second-best inﬂation index that gives
higher weight to sectors in which shocks manifest in larger output deviations from
efﬁcient levels. This policy closes the aggregate output gap but tolerates subopti-
mal inﬂation volatility and levels of sectoral output.
Goodfriend and King (1997) articulate this challenge, Aoki (2001) formally shows
it, Benigno (2004) apply these insights in a monetary union, Eusepi et al. (2011)
explore this issue quantitatively, and La’O and Tahbaz-Salehi (2022) and Rubbo
(2023) extend it to production networks.
We revisit this policy prescription in
light of the fact that monetary policy interacts with sectoral government demand
in shaping economic ﬂuctuations. Our analysis builds on and leverages insights
from earlier work in Cox et al. (2024). They use the universe of federal procure-
ment contracts in the U.S. to show that government demand is not a monolithic
aggregate—big G—but is the sum of rich, disaggregated policy decisions, giving
rise to challenges but also opportunities for stabilization policy.
Against this background we shift the focus of ﬁscal stabilization from the ag-
gregate to the sectoral level and ask: What is the optimal policy mix if monetary
policy and sectoral ﬁscal policy are jointly determined? Moreover, we derive pre-
dictions for sectoral government spending under optimal policy and ﬁnd sugges-
tive evidence that they are borne out in U.S. data. Thus, the stabilization role of
disaggregated ﬁscal policy is not just a theoretical possibility and we can contrast
it empirically with an optimal benchmark. We then trace out the implications for
monetary policy, in particular, the optimality of a zero-inﬂation policy to deal with
1See, among others, Pastén et al. (2020, 2024) and Bouakez et al. (2023).

disaggregated productivity shocks, and the desirability of the acyclical aggregate
ﬁscal policy observed in U.S. data.
We derive our insights in a New Keynesian multi-sector setup in which, build-
ing on the multi-country model of Galí and Monacelli (2008), the government de-
mands goods that contribute to welfare. The optimal, time-consistent mix of mone-
tary and ﬁscal policy prescribes a separation of roles: monetary policy takes care of
aggregate stabilization, whereas ﬁscal policy focuses on the sectoral level. We ob-
tain an intuitive rule for optimal sectoral ﬁscal policy: government demand should
be expansionary relative to the ﬁrst-best in sectors with negative inﬂation and out-
put gaps, that is, those sectors which experience positive productivity shocks.
The separation of roles hinges on the key trade-off in the design of joint mone-
tary and sectoral ﬁscal policies: Monetary policy is superior as a stabilization tool
to deal with productivity shocks, but government demand can be ﬁne tuned at
any required disaggregated level, contrary to monetary policy. The intuition holds
in a single-sector model: A positive productivity shock decreases prices and the
output gap. If monetary policy engineers a demand stimulus, the output gap can
be closed exactly when prices do not respond—a “divine coincidence”. The same
conclusion does not hold if government demand engineers the stimulus, because
it additionally crowds out consumption and thus affects labor supply. In addition,
monetary policy per se does not enter in welfare, whereas government demand
does by providing goods valued by households. Hence, even if a “divine coinci-
dence” were to exist for ﬁscal policy, it might be suboptimal to fully exploit it.2
In our model, optimal monetary policy deviates from a zero-inﬂation target.
Both monetary and sectoral ﬁscal policy give higher weight to sectors with stickier
prices, that is, those in which a given shock yields larger output gaps. However,
numerical exercises suggest that the deviation of optimal monetary policy from a
zero-inﬂation target is quantitatively small relative to a case when monetary policy
is the only stabilization tool. Yet, the ﬁrst best is never attained.
Complementary to these theoretical results, the following question naturally
arises: Is the disaggregated stabilization role of ﬁscal policy just a theoretical pos-
sibility or can we ﬁnd empirical support for it in U.S. data? First, as Cox et al. (2024)
2“Divine coincidence” may exist for ﬁscal policy but requires assuming a suboptimal ﬁscal
rule in a frictionless economy. We discuss this possibility in Appendix D.
2
argue, government purchases of goods and services are the most volatile compo-
nent of total government spending and exhibit substantial sectoral reallocation.
These facts suggest that government spending is ﬂexible enough to perform such
a stabilizing role. Second, the joint correlation of sectoral government demand, sec-
toral inﬂation and sectoral output in the data is indeed broadly consistent with the
theoretical optimal sectoral ﬁscal rule, but not with a purely aggregate ﬁscal sta-
bilization policy. We establish this result based on regression analyses, construct-
ing measures of government demand at the 4-digit NAICS sector level from US-
Aspending.gov, which covers the universe of federal procurement contracts from
2001 onwards, using Compustat sales data, producer price inﬂation from the BLS,
and a sectoral measure of the average frequency of price changes constructed by
Pastén et al. (2020, 2024). In particular, consistent with the theoretical optimal ﬁscal
rule, we ﬁnd that ﬁscal policy is more active in sectors in which prices are stickier.
We want to stress that we do not argue ﬁscal policy decisions follow the rules
we derive in the model. In reality, the allocation of government demand follows a
complicated political process involving Congress, lobbying and stakeholders inter-
acting in many layers, things we all abstract from in the model. A distinct literature
studies several aspects of such a process, see, for instance, Bisin et al. (2015) and
Halac and Yared (2022). Yet, we consider it useful to contrast the outcome of such
a process with an optimal ﬁscal policy that balances its direct welfare effects with
stabilization purposes. Remarkably, the model rules and its empirical counterparts
are similar. Given this alignment, we study the implications of optimal ﬁscal policy
on monetary policy and the cyclicality of aggregate government demand.
We also study the implications of our setting through the lens of the aggregate
Phillips curve. As stressed by Rubbo (2023), Guerrieri et al. (2021) and Afrouzi and
Bhattarai (2023), aggregation of sectoral Phillips curves yields an extra term akin to
an “aggregate cost-push shock" in setups with sectoral input-output interconnec-
tions and no ﬁscal policy. Such a result holds in any economy in which aggregation
is not trivial, including ours. In numerical exercises, we ﬁnd the volatility of the
“aggregate cost-push shock" is six times larger if monetary policy follows a zero-
inﬂation target instead of its optimal rule. Thus, even if a zero-inﬂation policy does
almost as well as optimal monetary policy when the government follows optimal
sectoral ﬁscal policy, it faces the practical challenge of dealing with highly volatile
3
“aggregate cost-push shocks.”
Finally, we highlight the implications of optimal ﬁscal policy for the cyclical-
ity of aggregate government demand. A well-established fact for advanced economies,
including the U.S., is that ﬁscal spending is largely acyclical (for instance, Talvi and
Vegh, 2005). This feature has been regarded as suggestive that ﬁscal policy does
not play a stabilization role (Chari et al., 2007). We ﬁnd a muted cyclicality is not
inconsistent with government demand playing a stabilization role; it just does it
at a disaggregated level. In our setup, if sectors were symmetric and the economy
were efﬁcient, optimal ﬁscal policy is perfectly cyclical. However, a milder cycli-
cality arises when the economy is inefﬁcient and the composition of private and
public demand differs across sectors, as in the U.S., with public demand tilted to-
wards stickier sectors (Cox et al., 2024). Cyclicality is even lower if monetary policy
follows standard inﬂation targeting as ﬁscal policy is even more active in this case.
The paper is structured as follows. The remainder of this introduction discusses
the related literature and our contribution. Section 2 lays out the model. Section 3
discusses the trade-offs which govern optimal policy, its objective function, and the
optimal ﬁscal and monetary policy rules we obtain. Section 4 presents the data and
empirical results supporting the idea that sectoral government demand does play
a disaggregated stabilization role. Section 5 studies its implications for monetary
policy and aggregate government demand. Section 6 concludes.
Related Literature.
In addition to work cited above, our analysis relates to four
strands of the literature. First, a line of work conducts a positive analysis on the
importance of sectors in ﬁscal policy transmission, notably the inﬂuential study
of Ramey and Shapiro (1998) and more recent work by Proebsting (2022), Flynn
et al. (2022) and Bouakez et al. (2022). Bouakez et al. (2023) develop richer multi-
sector models with input-output structures to shed light on the ﬁscal transmission
mechanism. In contrast to these papers, we offer a normative perspective.
Second, to do so, our analysis builds on work about the optimal adjustment of
government spending in aggregate economies if monetary policy is constrained by
the zero lower bound, or an exchange-rate target. Bianchi et al. (2023) study the
optimal adjustment of government spending in the presence of nominal rigidities
and sovereign risk in a open economy with an exchange rate peg. Such a setting
4
calls for a modiﬁed Samuelson rule which, absent frictions, requires optimal pol-
icy to equate the marginal beneﬁts of higher government spending to the marginal
costs of reduced private consumption. Hettig and Müller (2018) study the optimal
response of country-level government spending in a model of a monetary union
in which monetary policy is constrained by the effective lower bound. Bilbiie et
al. (2024) revisit the trade-offs for monetary and ﬁscal policy in a model that em-
phasizes household heterogeneity and inequality. Our analysis, instead, considers
a multi-sector closed-economy model and is focused on heterogeneities along the
production side of the economy.
Third, several papers show how taxes should adjust when monetary policy is
constrained by the zero lower bound (Eggertsson et al., 2004; Correia et al., 2013);
as well as the possibility of “non-conventional” ﬁscal policy to replicate a ﬁrst-best
when monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound as well as empir-
ical evidence (Correia et al., 2013; D’Acunto et al., 2018, 2022; Bachmann et al.,
2021). Farhi et al. (2014), in turn, consider a monetary union and study the opti-
mal tax policy which brings about a “ﬁscal devaluation” in response to country-
speciﬁc shocks; and Antonova and Müller (2024) study the optimal tax response
to sectoral shocks in the New Keynesian model with network structure. Woodford
(2022) studies transfers as a way to stabilize effective demand in a multi-sector
model. We focus instead on government spending ﬁnanced through lump-sum
taxes to isolate its optimal stabilization role.
Our analysis relates to earlier and recent work on ﬁscal rules. Galí and Per-
otti (2003), in particular, study how various ﬁscal instruments adjust to the cy-
cle based on a sample of European countries. Kliem and Kriwoluzky (2014) offer
a normative model-based assessment of alternative ﬁscal rules, Halac and Yared
(2018) study international coordination of ﬁscal rules, and Hatchondo et al. (2022)
focus on the performance of ﬁscal rules in a model of sovereign risk. In contrast,
assuming optimal policy, we establish a link between sectoral government spend-
ing, sectoral output gaps and sectoral inﬂation and show that granular data for
federal purchases is largely consistent with this relationship. Finally, we focus on
discretionary optimal monetary and ﬁscal policy. A large literature exists studying
policy without commitment in more complex environments, with Afrouzi et al.
(2023) being a recent example. We leave such extensions for future research.

A New Keynesian multi-sector model
We model the optimal allocation of government sectoral demand building on the
multi-country setup of Galí and Monacelli (2008). In our model, though, the sec-
toral composition of private and public demand is ﬂexible in line with the evidence
in Cox et al. (2024) and we consider time-consistent policies. Our model has K
sectors with a continuum of monopolistic competitive ﬁrms operating in each of
them. Prices are adjusted infrequently. A representative household provides labor
in competitive sectoral markets. Government purchases are ﬁnanced via lump-
sum taxes with its budget balanced at all times. Finally, monetary policy adjusts
the short-term nominal interest rate.

Setup
We now introduce the problem of the representative household, the allocation of
the government demand within and across sectors, and the ﬁrms’ problem.

ABSTRACT
Big G typically refers to aggregate government spending on a homogeneous good. In this paper, 
we open up this construct by analyzing the entire universe of procurement contracts of the US 
government and establish five facts. First, government spending is granular, that is, it is 
concentrated in relatively few firms and sectors. Second, relative to private expenditures its 
composition is biased. Third, procurement contracts are short-lived. Fourth, idiosyncratic 
variation dominates the fluctuation of spending. Last, government spending is concentrated in 
sectors with relatively sticky prices. Accounting for these facts within a stylized New Keynesian 
model offers new insights into the fiscal transmission mechanism: fiscal shocks hardly impact 
inflation, little crowding out of private expenditure exists, and the multiplier tends to be larger 
compared to a one-sector benchmark aligning the model with the empirical evidence.

Introduction
What is “Big G”? In the national accounts G refers to “government spending”—the part of
GDP that comprises government expenditures.
This convention possibly helps explain why
research on ﬁscal policy typically entertains a somewhat crude notion of government spending
as a homogeneous good, isomorphic to GDP. In empirical and theoretical work, we frequently
refer to it as Big G, and the literature assumes policy makers can freely adjust it over time—in
response to the business cycle, or for other reasons. The recent “renaissance of ﬁscal research”
survey by Ramey (2019) has changed little in this regard. A number of recent contributions
have started to study the role of heterogeneity for the ﬁscal transmission mechanism but focus
exclusively on heterogeneity on the household side (McKay and Reis, 2016; Auclert et al., 2018;
Hagedorn et al., 2019).
Starting point of our paper is the observation that Big G itself is fundamentally
heterogeneous. Government spending is not simply one large transaction. It is composed of
a large number of smaller transactions whose composition diﬀers from the other components
of aggregate demand. Empirically, we ﬁrst establish ﬁve facts about government spending by
characterizing the underlying components of Big G. In the second part of the paper, we then
study the role of these facts for the ﬁscal transmission mechanism through the lens of a stylized
two-sector New Keynesian model. Accounting for the heterogeneity of government spending has
ﬁrst-order eﬀects on the transmission mechanism aligning the model prediction with empirical
evidence.
We construct our empirical anatomy of Big G using a database that has only recently
become accessible: USASpending.gov. The database provides detailed information on the entire
universe of procurement contracts by the US federal government since 2001. These data capture
about half of federal consumption expenditures which, in turn, account for about one half of
general government spending. For each year, the database records several million government
procurement transactions. We establish ﬁve facts on the basis of detailed analysis of these data.1
The ﬁrst of our ﬁve facts is government spending is granular in the sense of Gabaix (2011).
Few ﬁrms and sectors supply a large share of government consumption: (i) The largest 20% of
suppliers supply 99% of government consumption. (ii) The top 10 ﬁrms—or the top 0.01% —
among all ﬁrms supplying goods and services to the federal government receive more than 35% of
all procurement contracts by value and the top 0.1% of ﬁrms receive almost 60%. (iii) The most
important suppliers to the federal government are concentrated in few sectors: ﬁrms in the largest
three out of the roughly 20 two-digit NAICS industries supply more than 60% of all government
1Defense spending accounts for more than one half of the transactions by value in our data set. We replicate
the ﬁve facts separately for defense and non-defense spending in Online Appendix A.5.

Notes. This ﬁgure shows the fraction of government spending in a certain sector on the y-axis and the fraction
of private spending in a certain sector over total private spending on the x-axis. We separate total federal
spending (blue circles) into defense spending (red asterisks) and non-defense spending (green triangles). We use
the BEA Use Table to calculate private consumption shares. The sample represents averages over the period
between 2001 and 2018.
contracts and the top 1 percent of just over 1,000 six-digit NAICS industries make up around
40% of all government spending. Decomposing the total cross-sectional variance of government
contracts, we ﬁnd almost 100% of the variation is “within” ﬁrms or sectors and almost none
is “across” ﬁrms or sectors providing further evidence of the granular nature of government
spending. The underlying cross-sectional size distribution of contracts is characterized by fat
tails, providing the basis for these facts.
The second fact is the existence of a sectoral bias in government spending: the share of
government spending in each sector diﬀers substantially from the share consumers spend on
the goods and services of that sector. Figure 1 shows the share of government spending in a
certain sector on the vertical axis, and the same ratio for private consumption on the horizontal
axis.
We separate total federal spending (blue circles) into defense spending (red asterisks)
and non-defense spending (green triangles).
Both for overall federal spending, but also for
both subcomponents, a substantial diﬀerence in the spending patterns of consumers and the
government exists. Some sectors that are negligible for the government make up about 14% of
private consumption, whereas sectors that are unimportant for consumers are big suppliers to the
2
government. This sectoral bias also holds for non-defense spending. Hence, government spending
varies across sectors and does not purely mimic consumer spending. In earlier work, Ramey and
Shapiro (1998) stressed the importance of sectoral bias for the ﬁscal transmission mechanism.
Until now, however, no data was available to establish the sectoral bias of government spending
systematically.
Third, we show government contracts have a short duration and are often modiﬁed. The
median contract has a duration of 36 days, 80 percent of contracts last less than one year, and
about 30 percent of contract transactions represent modiﬁcations to initial contracts. Hence,
the government does not tend to enter long-term contracts with suppliers. Only few contracts
lasts very long. The median ﬁrm supplying goods to the government is in the dataset for 2
years, while the ﬁrm with the median value of average annual obligations is in the dataset for
only 1 year.
Fourth, idiosyncratic shocks dominate the ﬂuctuations in government spending over time
– rather than in the cross section (which the ﬁrst fact studies).
To establish this fact, we
decompose growth rates following Gabaix (2011) and Foerster et al. (2011) and ﬁnd idiosyncratic
shocks, both at the ﬁrm and the sectoral level, are again key drivers of variation in government
spending over time. In addition, when we estimate AR(1) processes for government spending
at the sectoral level and study the correlations in the residual spending across sectors, we ﬁnd
aggregate shocks play a negligible role for changes in sectoral government spending over time.
Hence, large variation of government spending over time exists that variation in Big G cannot
account for. Instead, if an innovation occurs, it is idiosyncratic at the sectoral level. These
innovations have both large negative as well as large positive correlations for many sector pairs.
Overall, sectoral government spending is generally relatively persistent, consistent with our
cross-sectional variance decomposition.
Fifth, government consumption tends to be concentrated in sectors with a relatively high-
degree of price stickiness. The frequency of price changes in the top two two-digit NAICS sectors
is 9% while it is on average 20% for the remaining sectors in the economy. We use the micro
data underlying the producer price index at the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate these
frequencies. The average frequency of price adjustment overall is 16% which corresponds to
prices adjusting approximately every 6 months. Our detailed contract data allow us to further
characterize the way in which prices are sticky. The contract data contain information on the
types of contracts between buyer (the government) and sellers. The majority of contracts—over
85 percent— are “ﬁxed-price” in nature.
The facts we establish might not appear surprising but so far, no systematic evaluation
exists. To better understand whether they matter from a macro perspective, we feed these facts
into a two-sector New Keynesian model with government spending a la Woodford (2011) and

compare the implications of the model to a one-sector benchmark. The model is deliberately
stylized in order to account for the ﬁve facts as clearly as possible while only minimally departing
from the conventional one-sector model. Importantly, rather than postulating a process for Big
G, as is commonly done, we model government spending in each sector as a distinct variable.
Sectoral heterogeneity induces profound changes in the ﬁscal transmission mechanism in
our two-sector model relative to the benchmark economy. We derive a number of closed-form
results for the limiting case in which prices are completely ﬂexible in one sector. If government
spending is biased towards the ﬂex-price sector, crowding out of private expenditure can be
inﬁnite. Empirically, however, government spending is biased towards the sticky-price sector. An
increase of government spending in the sticky-price sector induces little crowding out of private
expenditure, and hence the output multiplier is considerably larger relative to the one-sector
benchmark.
We also run model simulations and show the sectoral heterogeneity of government spending
matters quantitatively. Specially, we calibrate the model to capture key features of the data,
including the actual degree of price rigidities as well as the sectoral composition of government
spending and the relative size of sectors. A ﬁscal shock in the relatively small and sticky-price
sector towards which government spending is biased induces a multiplier eﬀect about three times
larger than a shock in the other sector. Moreover, the multiplier becomes even bigger if prices
are more ﬂexible in the sector in which private expenditure is concentrated. Hence, just like
Barsky et al. (2007) and Barsky et al. (2016) show for the transmission of monetary policy, we
ﬁnd the degree of price stickiness in the sector in which government spending is concentrated is
essential and not the economy-wide stickiness.
In the New Keynesian model, monetary policy is also key for the ﬁscal transmission
mechanism (Woodford, 2011; Christiano et al., 2011; Farhi and Werning, 2016). Government
spending is inﬂationary and thus (generally) triggers a response of the central bank.
The
resulting interest rate increase crowds out private expenditure because of intertemporal
substitution.
As a result, the multiplier is smaller than unity—in contrast to the textbook
IS-LM model in which no intertemporal substitution takes place.
In related work, Boehm
(2019) distinguishes between government consumption and government investment and ﬁnds the
multiplier is particularly small for government investment precisely because the intertemporal
elasticity of substitution of investment demand tends to be high. Auerbach and Gorodnichenko
(2012a,b) and Ramey and Zubairy (2018) discuss empirically whether government spending
multipliers are larger in recessions and periods of low interest rates when monetary policy
might be less responsive to government spending. A number of recent contributions introduce
household heterogeneity and credit frictions in New Keynesian models in order to limit
intertemporal substitution (Gal´ı et al., 2007; McKay et al., 2016; Kaplan et al., 2018).
As

a result, multipliers tend to be larger.
We show sectoral heterogeneity in spending by households and the government combined
with sectoral heterogeneity in pricing frictions has a similar eﬀect and as a result, the New
Keynesian model becomes “more Keynesian.” In a nutshell, since the government spends in
relatively sticky-price sectors and the private sector spends in relatively ﬂexible-price sectors,
inﬂation is more responsive to private expenditure than to government spending.
Such
diﬀerential heterogeneity in turn dampens the monetary response to a ﬁscal impulse:
less
intertemporal substitution occurs, less crowding out, and the multiplier is larger.
We also
show, however, things are turned up-side down at the zero lower bound (ZLB). The ranking
of multipliers across sectors ﬂips: raising government spending in the relatively ﬂexible sector
has now a larger impact because no interest rate response occurs to curb the larger inﬂationary
pressure and hence more crowding in of private consumption happens.
Empirically, accounting for sectoral heterogeneity helps the model to generate predictions
that align better with the time series evidence than predictions from the conventional one-sector
model. Many studies have established the response of interest rates, both nominal and real, as
well as the response of inﬂation to ﬁscal shocks tends to be weak or even negative (Mountford
and Uhlig, 2009; Corsetti et al., 2012; Ramey, 2016) which is exactly what our model generates.
Once we modify the model to account for the evidence on government spending at the micro
level, the model also gets the macro evidence right. Our data also allow studying whether ﬁscal
multipliers diﬀer for defense versus non-defense spending but we leave a systematic analysis of
ﬁscal multipliers for future work.
Our paper is related to recent work on the eﬀect of regional ﬁscal policies in monetary
unions (Gal´ı and Monacelli, 2008; Nakamura and Steinsson, 2014; Hettig and M¨uller, 2018). In
this literature, government spending is concentrated in some spatial partition of the economy,
and its composition is biased relative to the composition of private expenditures. Just like in our
analysis, the eﬀects of ﬁscal policy turn out to be highly sensitive to the conduct of monetary
policy. In contrast to this earlier work, we model private expenditure as being determined at the
aggregate level rather than at the regional/ sectoral level. Chodorow-Reich (2019) surveys the
recent empirical work on government spending multipliers based on cross-sectional data. Last,
we also share modeling features with a number of recent papers that account for heterogeneity
on the production side across sectors and ﬁrms, tracing out the implications for the business
cycle (Acemoglu et al., 2012; Pasten et al., 2019a,b; Baqaee and Farhi, 2019; Ozdagli and Weber,
2017). Bouakez et al. (2018), in particular, study theoretically the transmission of ﬁscal policy
shocks in a rich model featuring heterogeneity in sector size and input-output structure.

Data
2.1
Background on USASpending
In the ﬁrst part of this paper, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the USASpending.gov
database—the oﬃcial source for federal spending data.2
We ﬁrst detail and deﬁne several
fundamental concepts before we move on to analyze the data. The database was created in
response to the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA), which was
signed into law on September 26, 2006.
FFATA requires federal contract, grant, loan, and
other ﬁnancial assistance awards of more than $25,000 are publicly accessible on a searchable
website, in an eﬀort to provide transparency to the American people on how the government
spends their tax dollars. In accordance with FFATA, federal agencies are required to collect
and report data on federal procurement. Agencies must report award data—contracts, grants,
loans, and other ﬁnancial assistance— on a monthly basis through various government systems
such as the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS-NG) for contract data and the Data Act
Broker for grant, loan, and other ﬁnancial assistance data. Some agencies report frequently
during a month, while others report once a month or even less frequently if they do not issue
awards on a monthly basis. The USASpending.gov database which the Treasury Department
hosts, compiles the data from the various government reporting systems. In addition to directly
uploading the information which the federal agencies report to systems like the FPDS-NG, the
site also utilizes information collected from the recipients of the awards themselves. Though
FFATA was not signed into law until 2006, data are available back to 2001 through an external
organization.
2.2
What are Government Contracts?
Our data focus on a subset of federal spending—spending on goods and services via government
contracts. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) deﬁnes “Contract actions” as “any oral or
written action that results in the purchase, rent, or lease of supplies or equipment, services, or
construction using appropriated dollars over the micro-purchase threshold, or modiﬁcations to
these actions regardless of dollar value.” The micro-purchase threshold is in general $3,500.
As the deﬁnition suggests, the goods and services that the government consumes through
contracts span a wide range, from janitorial services for federal buildings to IT support services
to airplanes and rockets. Contracts can be short-term—e.g., a one-month contact awarded by
the Department of Agriculture Rural Housing Service to Sikes Property And Appraisal Service
2Demyanyk et al. (2019) and Auerbach et al. (2019) also rely on this database but their focus is on estimating
ﬁscal multipliers. They rely exclusively on contracts awarded by the Department of Defense. On average, these
account for about half of the transactions in the database by count and for about two thirds by value. Appendix A.2
provides an overview of other similar data that have been used in the literature.

Missing Tax Instruments:
Attaining Production Efficiency in Disaggregated,
Production Network Economies with Nominal Rigidities*

January 6, 2025
Abstract
We study optimal fiscal and monetary policy in multi-sector, input-output
economies with nominal rigidities and a rich set of tax instruments. Irrespective
of the network structure, with N>1 sectors, production efficiency can be achieved
with 2N state-contingent, sector-specific tax instruments. The optimal tax scheme
involves jointly stabilizing all prices set by sellers while generating efficient move-
ments in after-tax prices faced by buyers. Optimal fiscal and monetary policy are
independent of the vector of price rigidities; optimal sector-specific tax rates are
moreover independent of the availability of lump-sum taxes. We provide several tax
equivalences and non-equivalences.
Keywords: fiscal policy, monetary policy, production efficiency, production net-
works, misallocation.

Introduction
In multi-sector, input-output economies with nominal rigidities, the first best allocation
is generically unattainable with monetary policy alone (Aoki, 2001; Woodford, 2003b,
2010; La’O and Tahbaz-Salehi, 2022). Even when shocks are exclusively technological,
as long as tax instruments are non-state-contingent, monetary policy can attain at most
a “third-best” allocation: one that features production inefficiency and an endogenous,
state-contingent labor wedge (La’O and Tahbaz-Salehi, 2022; Rubbo, 2023). Optimal
monetary policy in multi-sector economies thereby contrasts sharply to its one-sector
counterpart: in the standard New Keynesian (NK) model with technology shocks, the
first best is achievable with price level stabilization and a constant sales subsidy.
From this observation one might conclude that there are “missing” tax instru-
ments in the multi-sector, input-output NK framework. Indeed, it is clear that a state-
contingent labor income or consumption tax could eliminate the state-contingent labor
wedge. It is less clear, however, what tax instruments would restore production effi-
ciency. The heart of the problem is the following. In this class of models, monetary pol-
icy can target at most one price index. But with sector-specific technology shocks and
nominal rigidities, no price index can eliminate misallocation both within and across
sectors. To this end, finer-tuned fiscal instruments appear necessary.
But what instruments? And in what manner should they to be used? We address
these questions in this paper. Within a broad class of multi-sector NK models with
input-output linkages, and allowing for a rich set of fiscal instruments, we jointly char-
acterize optimal monetary and fiscal policy. Our main result is to demonstrate how dis-
tortionary taxation can be used to restore production efficiency and thereby circumvent
the problem faced by monetary policy. The tax scheme we engineer involves jointly sta-
bilizing all prices set by sellers while generating efficient movements in after-tax prices
faced by buyers.
In any environment with nominal rigidities, fiscal and monetary policy interact:
the efficacy and optimality of monetary policy depend on the details of fiscal policy.
The contribution of this paper is to thereby establish the theoretical benchmark of
sufficiently rich fiscal instruments within the class of multi-sector, input-output NK
economies. Our benchmark differs markedly from—and, in fact, constitutes the polar
opposite of—the standard benchmark of “inactive” fiscal policy in which subsidies are
used only to eliminate steady-state markups. As argued above, the distance between the
two benchmarks is small to non-existent in the one-sector NK framework but widens
with multiple sectors and intermediate good trade. Recent papers consider environ-
ments in the interior of this gap.
Prior to studying monetary policy in environments featuring restricted sets of “ac-
1
tive” fiscal instruments, it would be useful to first understand the sufficiently rich fiscal
instruments benchmark. What are the missing fiscal tools that restricted sets may or
may not compensate for? Answering this question, characterizing these instruments,
and establishing this benchmark is what we do in this paper.
The Model and Results. Firms are linked to one another via an input-output network.
They produce goods using labor, capital, and intermediate inputs and are subject to
industry-level productivity shocks, demand shocks, and shocks to elasticities of substi-
tution (or markups). Following the NK framework, firms set prices and face Calvo price
rigidities; we allow the Calvo parameter to vary by sector. A representative household
consumes the final good, supplies labor, saves, and invests in capital. A government
finances exogenous public expenditure and sets fiscal and monetary policy jointly.
We take the standard Ramsey approach and assume the government has access to
a rich set of distortionary, linear tax instruments—including multiple types of sector-
specific, state-contingent tax rates—but cannot raise money with lump-sum taxation.
The latter restriction on fiscal instruments implies that full efficiency, i.e. the “first best,”
cannot be achieved; we later relax this restriction in an extension.
Our main analysis centers on implementation of the Ramsey optimum, which in our
economy coincides with the canonical Lucas and Stokey (1983) benchmark. We focus
on the Ramsey optimum for the following reason: this benchmark exhibits production
efficiency in the sense of Diamond and Mirrlees (1971); see Chari and Kehoe (1999).
Implementation of the Ramsey optimum therefore demonstrates how a sufficiently rich
set of fiscal instruments can restore production efficiency in this class of economies.
Our main theorem characterizes monetary and fiscal policy that jointly implement
the Ramsey optimum. Without loss of generality, we focus on implementations in which
monetary policy stabilizes the final good price level. Our characterization of optimal
fiscal policy yields the following six lessons:
1. The optimal tax structure achieves production efficiency. In order to do so, sector-
specific tax rates play two roles: they stabilize seller prices and generate efficient
fluctuations in after-tax prices.
2. Optimal sector-specific tax rates are state-contingent. They depend on the real-
ized nominal wage, sectoral technologies, and sectoral elasticities of substitution,
but they do not depend on sectoral demand shocks and government spending.
Optimal monetary and fiscal policy are invariant to the vector of price rigidities.
3. Regardless of the network structure, with N sectors production efficiency can be
attained with 2N sector-specific tax instruments: N sales taxes levied on sellers
and N sales taxes levied on buyers. Unlike in standard models with price flexibil-
2
ity, taxes levied on sellers and on buyers when sellers face price rigidities are not
equivalent.
4. Sector-specific input taxes on labor, capital, and intermediate goods can substi-
tute for the seller-imposed sales taxes. In this implementation, intermediate good
input taxes are destination-specific but not origin-specific.
5. Sector-specific intermediate good and final good taxes can substitute for the
buyer-imposed sales taxes. In this implementation, intermediate good input taxes
are origin-specific but not destination-specific.
6. Optimal sector-specific tax rates are independent of the availability of lump-sum
taxes.
What roles do the sector-specific tax instruments play in restoring production effi-
ciency? Lesson 1 answers this question. Production efficiency requires no misalloca-
tion within and across sectors—a goal unattainable with monetary policy alone. The
tax scheme we engineer involves jointly stabilizing seller prices while simultaneously
generating efficient movements in after-tax prices faced by buyers. This tax scheme
eliminates misallocation within and across sectors, ensuring efficient production of the
final good.
These dual roles require tax state-contingency. Lesson 2 tells us what dimensions of
the state space the optimal sector-specific taxes are contingent upon. It also answers
the more practical question of what information is needed by the fiscal authority in
order to administer such taxes. We find that the optimal tax rates are contingent on
realized marginal costs and elasticities of substitution or, more generally, desired mark-
ups. While this is arguably a heavy information burden for the fiscal authority, what is
perhaps more surprising are the dimensions of the state space the optimal tax rates are
not contingent upon. Conditional on realized marginal costs, sector-specific tax rates
are independent of sector-specific demand and government spending.
We find that for any implementation of the Ramsey optimum, tax rates are inde-
pendent of the vector of sectoral price rigidities (Calvo parameters). The irrelevance
of sectoral price rigidities for optimal fiscal and monetary policy, even when the opti-
mal allocation does not coincide with the first best, generalizes previously-established
results by Correia, Nicolini and Teles (2008) to multi-sector NK economies with input-
output linkages.
Lessons 1 and 2 are general in that they apply to all implementations of the Ramsey
optimum. Moving on, we explore specific tax implementations. The first is the “least
instruments” implementation: we show that, irrespective of the input-output structure,
3
with N>1 sectors and two roles for taxes, 2N sector-specific taxes can implement the
Ramsey optimum (Lesson 3). This implementation requires N sales taxes levied on
sellers and N sales taxes levied on buyers. We thus exploit a non-equivalence between
sales taxes collected on sellers and on buyers when sellers face nominal rigidities, as
highlighted by Poterba, Rotemberg and Summers (1986).
Despite this particular tax non-equivalence, we present two more implementations
that showcase two different tax equivalences. In the first, we assume that the seller-
imposed sales tax is unavailable.
The Ramsey optimum can still be implemented:
sector-specific taxes on labor, capital, and intermediate good inputs can substitute for
the missing seller-imposed sales tax (Lesson 4). In the second, we assume that the
buyer-imposed sales tax instrument is unavailable. The Ramsey optimum can again
be implemented: sector-specific intermediate good and final good taxes can substitute
for the missing buyer-imposed sales tax (Lesson 5).
Whether or not the first-best is attainable depends on the availability of lump-sum
tax instruments. A question arises as to whether the availability of lump-sum taxa-
tion alters the optimal sector-specific tax instruments. We show that the answer is no:
whether or not the Ramsey optimum coincides with the first-best changes only the op-
timal aggregate tax rates—it has no effect on the optimal sector-specific tax rates (Les-
son 6). The irrelevance of lump-sum taxation for the optimal sector-specific tax rates
drives home the point that their main function is to restore within-period production
efficiency.
Related literature. This paper demonstrates how a rich set of distortionary tax instru-
ments can be used to implement the Ramsey optimum and completely circumvent the
problem faced by monetary policy. In this sense, our paper is closest in spirit to Correia,
Nicolini and Teles (2008) and Correia, Farhi, Nicolini and Teles (2013). Our contribution
vis-`a-vis their work is to extend this insight to multi-sector, input-output NK economies
and, specifically, to characterize within this class of models the sector-level tax rates that
attain production efficiency.
Our results apply to a broad class of multi-sector NK models with or without input-
output linkages. Our framework is fairly general in that it can flexibly nest the economic
environments found in Erceg, Henderson and Levin (2000); Aoki (2001); Mankiw and
Reis (2003); Benigno (2004); Huang and Liu (2005); Woodford (2010); Eusepi, Hobijn and
Tambalotti (2011); Ozdagli and Weber (2017); Past´en, Schoenle and Weber (2020, 2024);
Ghassibe (2021); La’O and Tahbaz-Salehi (2022); Rubbo (2023); Bouakez, Rachedi and
Santoro (2023); Afrouzi and Bhattarai (2023); Xu and Yu (2024), among others.1 Relative
1Related, too, is the work of Faria-e-Castro (2021), Guerrieri et al. (2022), Baqaee and Farhi (2022), and
Rubbo (2024). These papers focus on disaggregated, multi-sector NK models with and without input-
output linkages but feature some form of household heterogeneity. For this reason, our model does not

to most multi-sector NK models, we add physical capital as a factor of production.
As we have noted, the contribution of our paper vis-`a-vis the multi-sector, input-
output NK literature is to establish a benchmark in which the set of tax instruments
is sufficiently rich to achieve production efficiency. A standard benchmark in this lit-
erature is to assume non-state-contingent sales subsidies that eliminate steady-state
markups (as in Woodford, 2003b; Gal´ı, 2008). Recent papers, however, move past this
benchmark and consider the implications of sector-specific and state-contingent gov-
ernment purchases: see Proebsting (2022); Cox et al. (2024); Flynn et al. (2024); Bouakez
et al. (2024) as well as Ramey and Shapiro (1998). In a taxonomy of models, one can
think of these environments as featuring a set of fiscal instruments that is strictly larger
than in the standard benchmark, yet restricted relative to our sufficiently rich fiscal
instrument benchmark.
We complement this growing body of work but focus instead on linear tax instru-
ments. Furthermore, an understanding of both benchmarks—or, both extremes—is
useful for interpreting the interior.
Layout. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the economic
environment; in Section 3 we characterize equilibria. In Section 4 we state and solve the
Ramsey problem, and in Section 5 we study its implementation. In Section 6 we explore
several specific implementations that illustrate the main results of the paper. In Section
7 we conclude. All proofs are found in the Appendix.

The Environment
Time is discrete, indexed by t = 0, 1, . . . , ∞. We denote the aggregate state at time t by
st ∈S where S is a finite set. We let st = {s0, ..., st} ∈St denote a history of states up
to and including st. We let µ(st|st−1) denote the probability of history st conditional on
st−1, and with slight abuse of notation we let µ(st) denote the unconditional probability
of history st.
There is a representative household with time-separable utility:

explicitly capture these environments. In another related vein, Ghassibe and Ferrari (2024) develop and
analyze a multi-sector, production network model with endogenous price rigidities due to menu costs.
Our model instead features exogenous nominal rigidities: in our baseline we assume Calvo pricing, but
our model can also accommodate informational frictions. Finally, Qiu, Wang, Xu and Zanetti (2024) study
monetary policy in a small open economy with domestic and cross-border input-output linkages. Our
model is closely related but features no international trade.

with β ∈(0, 1), where C(st) and L(st) denote the household’s consumption basket and
labor supply at date t, history st. The function U satisfies the typical regularity condi-
tions: it is continuous, twice-differentiable, strictly increasing and strictly concave in
(Ct, −Lt), and satisfies Inada conditions. Throughout, we let UC(st) ≡∂U(·)/∂C(st) and
UL(st) ≡∂U(·)/∂L(st).
The household supplies labor, consumes, saves, and invests in capital. The house-
hold’s nominal budget constraint at time t, history st is given by:
(1 + τ C(st))P(st)C(st) + P(st)H(st) + B(st) +
X
st+1|st
Q(st+1|st)Z(st+1|st)
≤(1 −τ L(st))W(st)L(st) + (1 −τ K(st))R(st)K(st−1) + (1 + ι(st−1))B(st−1) + Z(st|st−1)
(2)
where P(st) is the price of the final good, W(st) is the nominal wage, and R(st) is the
nominal rental rate on capital. The household faces taxes on consumption, labor in-
come, and capital income, denoted by τ C(st), τ L(st), and τ K(st), respectively.
The household can borrow and save via three separate instruments. The first is a
one-period, risk-free nominal bond, B(st), which the household can buy or sell at time
t, history st, and which pays (1 + ι(st))B(st) units of money one period later. The house-
hold’s debt holdings are bounded by B(st) ≥−D for some large constant D. We let B−1
denote initial holdings of government debt. The second instrument is a complete set of
state-contingent Arrow securities, indexed by st+1|st. We let Q(st+1|st) denote the price
at time t, history st, of an Arrow security that pays 1 unit of money in t + 1 if st+1 is
realized and 0 otherwise. The corresponding quantity purchased of this Arrow security
is denoted by Z(st+1|st).
Third, the household can invest in capital; we let H(st) denote the household’s in-
vestment in capital at date t, history st. The law of motion of capital is given by:
K(st) = (1 −δ)K(st−1) + H(st),
(3)
where δ ∈(0, 1] is the rate of depreciation. We assume the household is endowed with
K−1 > 0 initial units of capital at time 0. The household solves the following problem.

Intermediate good production.
Production takes place in a finite set of N>1 indus-
tries indexed by i ∈I ≡{1, . . . , N}. Each industry consists of two types of firms: (i)
6
a measure one continuum of monopolistically-competitive, differentiated good firms,
indexed by m ∈[0, 1], and (ii) a perfectly-competitive producer that aggregates the
industry’s differentiated goods and produces a uniform sectoral good. We begin by
describing the latter.
Sectoral good production. Within each industry i ∈I, a perfectly-competitive firm
produces a uniform, sectoral good using a constant returns to scale, constant elasticity
of substitution (CES) production technology over the sector’s differentiated varieties,
m ∈[0, 1], given by:
Yi(st) =

where θi(st) > 1 denotes the elasticity of substitution across varieties in state st, and
ym
i (st) denotes the quantity purchased of variety m. The sectoral good producer takes
prices as given and maximizes profits, given by:
Pi(st)Yi(st) −(1 + ˆτ y
i (st))
 1

i (st)dm
where Pi(st) is the price of sectoral good i, ˆτ y
i (st) is the sales tax the firm pays on its
purchases of the differentiated varieties, and pm
i (st) is the price of differentiated good m.
Profit maximization yields the following CES demand curves:
ym
i (st) =

By constant returns to scale, this producer makes zero profits.2 The good produced by
sector i can be used for final good purposes or as an intermediate input to production.
Differentiated goods production. Within each industry i ∈I, a measure one con-
tinuum of monopolistically-competitive firms use a common constant-returns-to-scale
technology to transform labor, capital, and intermediate inputs into differentiated vari-
eties. The production function of firm m in industry i is given by
ym
i (st) = Ai(st)Fi(ℓm

where ym
i (st) is firm output, ℓm
i (st) and km
i (st) are the firm’s labor and capital inputs, and
for every j ∈I, xm
ij(st) is the firm’s usage of intermediate good j. We let Ai(st) denote
an industry-specific productivity shock. The production function Fi is homogeneous of
degree one. Throughout, we assume that labor is an essential input for the production
2We include this producer to ensure that a homogeneous sectoral good is produced while also allowing
for monopolistic competition among the differentiated good firms.

Distorted Prices and Targeted Taxes
in the New Keynesian Network Model∗
Anastasiia Antonova and Gernot J. Müller
September 2025
Abstract
When confronted with sectoral shocks, policymakers often resort to targeted, sector-
specific taxes in an ad hoc fashion. Based on the New Keynesian Network model, we
characterize the optimal tax response to sectoral shocks: it features twice as many tax
instruments as there are sectors, is budget-neutral, and not confined to the sector where
the shock originates. We show that the optimal policy can be approximated by a simple
rule that responds to inflation in the shocked sector and adjusts tax instruments in other
sectors according to input-output linkages. We study its quantitative performance in
a calibrated version of the model.

Introduction
Macroeconomic shocks often originate in specific sectors of the economy or impact them
disproportionally (Foerster et al. 2011; Gabaix 2011; Cox et al. 2024a).
In response to
such shocks, governments frequently implement targeted subsidies or taxes. For example,
governments provided transfers and subsidies to address the energy crisis triggered by the
Russian invasion of Ukraine, offered support to the financial sector during the global financial
crisis, and extended financial aid to the service sector during the Covid-19 pandemic. Such
targeted fiscal measures appear appropriate, particularly because monetary policy cannot
be tailored to specific sectors, except through unconventional measures that have a distinct
fiscal flavor.
However, these tax policies are typically implemented on an ad hoc basis, and little is
known about how they should be optimally adjusted in response to sectoral shocks. For
instance, should the response be confined to the sector where the shock originates, or should
upstream and downstream sectors also be considered? What are the budgetary implications
of the optimal policy? Does the nature of the shock—supply versus demand—matter? Can
an efficient allocation be achieved, and if so, how many tax instruments are necessary to
achieve it? Lastly, concerns may arise about the feasibility of the optimal policy. Specifically,
what kind of information must policymakers have to execute the optimal policy?
We address these questions within a variant of the New Keynesian Network (NKN) model
of Rubbo (2023). We augment the model by allowing for sector-specific and potentially time-
varying sales taxes and production subsidies. As a result it becomes possible for the optimal
policy to restore the efficient allocation in the presence of sectoral shocks. Crucially, the
first-best policy requires the joint adjustment of both instruments across all sectors. This
is essential: since only a subset of firms adjusts prices, relative prices are distorted both
within and across sectors. Thus, in line with the principles of Tinbergen (1952), replicating
the flexible-price allocation necessitates using two instruments to address both sides of the
1
distortion.
This involves subsidizing firms’ production while simultaneously taxing their
sales. We propose a simple rule that responds solely to sectoral inflation and show that it
approximates the first-best policy arbitrarily well. This policy is budget-neutral and adjusts
taxes and subsidies across all sectors based on their proximity to the sector where the shock
originates and depending on the nature of the shock.
The NKN model offers a framework to systematically analyze sectoral stabilization poli-
cies. It features N sectors which are connected through input-output linkages. Production
in each sector uses labor and intermediate goods, potentially sourced from all sectors. In
each sector, there is a continuum of monopolistically competitive firms that operate identical
technologies but adjust prices only infrequently and, importantly, asynchronously. Factor
inputs within a sector are adjusted flexibly and instantaneously in order to meet demand
at posted prices. Households allocate spending across sectors in order to minimize expendi-
tures subject to sectoral demand shocks. There are also sector-specific shocks to total factor
productivity, or “supply shocks,” for short. We derive the canonical representation of the
model featuring a set of dynamic IS-curves and Phillips curves.
The relation between sectoral inflation and the sectoral output gap features a tradeoff
because adjusting a sector’s relative price to close its output gap creates price dispersion
within the sector, as not all firms adjust their prices simultaneously. Conversely, keeping
prices constant to avoid within-sector price dispersion results in output gaps due to the lack
of an adjustment of relative prices. A key property of the optimal policy follows directly: It
relies on two instruments in each sector (2N policy). Intuitively, by subsidizing production
in a sector, the policy incentivizes firms that can adjust prices to keep them stable. Through
sales taxes, which apply to consumers and intermediate goods trade alike, it steers demand
across sectors to close sectoral output gaps.
As a result, seller prices do not change in
equilibrium under the optimal tax policy.1 The network structure determines the response of
1Sales taxes effectively take over the job of ensuring allocative efficiency across sectors by altering buyer
prices. In this sense, our results turn the “socialist calculation debate” about the allocative role of prices
on its head (Von Mises 1953; Lerner 1934; Lange 1936). As prices fail to respond sufficiently, taxes can be
adjusted in their stead to signal scarcity to buyers.

fiscal instruments across sectors: The optimal policy adjusts the sales tax and the production
subsidy in all sectors, but the strength of the adjustment depends on the “distance” of a
sector to the sector where the shock originates, as well as on the nature of the shock. The
optimal policy is budget neutral as the subsidy is funded by the sales tax.
The first-best policy requires observing a rich set of sectoral shocks, which might be
infeasible in practice. Hence, we propose a simple rule that also features 2N sectoral instru-
ments but responds to sectoral inflation only rather than to the shock itself. As such, it is a
generalization of a familiar result from the normative analysis of monetary policy. A policy
reaction to inflation brings the economy closer to the efficient allocation when tracing the
natural rate directly is infeasible (Galí 2015). In the NKN model, the implementation of the
simple rule actually does not require observing inflation in every sector of the economy. It
is sufficient to respond to the inflationary impact in the shocked sector and to adjust taxes
and subsidies in the other sectors proportionally to their use of inputs from or their sales to
the shocked sector.
We perform a quantitative assessment of 2N policies, as we calibrate the model to cap-
ture key features of the production network in the U.S. economy. Specifically, we consider
N = 373 sectors based on the 6-digit classification of the Bureau of Economic Analysis and
allow pricing frictions to differ in line with existing empirical evidence. We contrast policy
responses to supply and demand shocks, highlighting how downstream and upstream prox-
imity to the shocked sector shapes the strength of the response in each case. We also show
that the simple 2N rule entails a substantial welfare improvement over rules that employ
only a single instrument.
Finally, we show that our results extend to an open-economy setting with import-price
shocks, which act as both supply and demand shocks and require distinct policy responses
depending on a country’s import dependence. We illustrate this by contrasting scenarios of
high and low energy dependence, capturing—in a highly stylized way—the situations of the
U.S. and Europe during the energy crisis following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The paper is structured as follows. In the remainder of the introduction, we place the
paper in the context of the literature. Section 2 presents the model and derives its canonical
representation, which we use to characterize the optimal policy in closed form and to analyze
its features in Section 3. In Section 4 we characterize simple rules polices that could be
implemented in practice.
We calibrate and simulate the model in order to quantify our
results in Section 5. Section 6 generalizes our results to an open economy setting. A final
section concludes.
Related literature.
Closest to our analysis is La’O & Tahbaz-Salehi (2025), who shows
that fiscal instruments can ensure efficiency in economies with production networks and nom-
inal rigidities. Using the Ramsey approach, the authors also find that the first-best policy
involves 2N instruments, highlighting the connection with the literature on monetary–fiscal
equivalence (Correia et al. 2008). Our analysis differs in that we derive the canonical rep-
resentation of the NKN model to capture the relevant trade-offs and examine second-best
fiscal policies that are more realistically implementable through simple rules. Cox et al.
(2024b) focus on sectoral government spending—which we abstract from—and show, in a
New Keynesian multi-sector model, that the optimal policy does not fully restore the first-
best allocation because, when the level of public-good provision is initially set optimally,
running “fiscal gaps” entails welfare costs.
More broadly, our paper relates to work on how sectoral shocks propagate through net-
works, typically with a focus on TFP shocks and in models without nominal frictions (Hor-
vath 1998, 2000; Acemoglu et al. 2012; Caliendo et al. 2017), but also in versions of the
NKN model (Pastén et al. 2024). The effects of sectoral government spending shocks are
also investigated, in models with and without pricing frictions (Proebsting 2022; Bouakez et
al. 2025; Flynn et al. 2022; Devereux et al. 2023), as well as the sectoral transmission of the
economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic (Guerrieri et al. 2022; Baqaee & Farhi 2022).2
2Woodford (2022) shows, assuming pre-set prices, that fiscal transfers can restore the first-best outcome
in this context when incomplete markets prevent risk sharing across sectors.
