## Slide 1: Motivation & Related Literature

### Claim 1: "Aoki (2001): Optimal monetary policy targets sticky prices. First-best achievable..."
- **Source:** Aoki (2001), *Journal of Monetary Economics*.
- **Verification:** ✅ **Verified.** Aoki shows that with flexible wages and no IO, targeting inflation in the sticky-price sector replicates the flexible-price allocation (First Best).

### Claim 2: "Rubbo (2023): Input-output networks amplify misallocation. Divine Coincidence fails -> Monetary policy alone is only constrained-optimal."
- **Source:** Rubbo (2023), *Econometrica*.
- **Verification:** ✅ **Verified.**
    - *Quote:* "Even when shocks are exclusively technological... monetary policy can attain at most a 'third-best' allocation." (Abstract/Intro).
    - *Quote:* "IO linkages break divine coincidence..." (Model Section).
    - *Correction Applied:* Updated Slide 6 to clarify "constrained-optimal" vs "first-best".

### Claim 3: "Cox et al. (2024): Sectoral fiscal policy restores Divine Coincidence (assuming no IO)."
- **Source:** Cox et al. (2024), *NBER WP 32914*.
- **Verification:** ✅ **Verified.**
    - *Data:* Table 3 shows Welfare Loss with "Optimal Fiscal" is 2.8, close to "Optimal MP" 2.8, while "Zero Inflation" is 3.1. Without fiscal, Zero Inflation is 6.3.
    - *Interpretation:* Fiscal policy allows simple MP (Zero Inflation) to approximate the optimal outcome.

## Slide 3: The Theoretical Benchmark (Merged)

### Claim 4: "La'O & Tahbaz-Salehi (2025): 2N sector-specific taxes... implement the efficient allocation (Ramsey optimum)."
- **Source:** La'O & Tahbaz-Salehi (2025), *Missing Tax Instruments*, Abstract.
- **Verification:** ✅ **Verified.**
    - *Quote:* "Irrespective of the network structure, with N>1 sectors, **production efficiency can be achieved with 2N state-contingent, sector-specific tax instruments**."

### Claim 5: "Antonova & Müller (2025): Replicate the flexible-price allocation."
- **Source:** Antonova & Müller (2025), *CESifo WP 12144*, Abstract.
- **Verification:** ✅ **Verified.**
    - *Quote:* "...replicating the **flexible-price allocation** necessitates using two instruments..."
    - *Quote:* "...features twice as many tax instruments as there are sectors..." (i.e., $2N$).

### Claim 6: "Mechanism: Jointly stabilizing seller prices and generating efficient relative-price movements for buyers."
- **Source:** La'O & Tahbaz-Salehi (2025), Abstract.
- **Verification:** ✅ **Verified.**
    - *Quote:* "The optimal tax scheme we engineer involves jointly stabilizing all prices set by sellers while generating efficient movements in after-tax prices faced by buyers."

## Slide 6: From Subsidies to Government Spending

### Claim 7: "Rubbo: Network Phillips curve identifies a divine coincidence index, but MP targeting it is constrained-optimal (not first-best)."
- **Source:** Rubbo (2023).
- **Verification:** ✅ **Verified.** See Claim 2.

### Claim 8: "Cox et al. (2024, Big G): Procurement accounts for the bulk of variation in G... highly concentrated... distinct from private consumption."
- **Source:** Cox et al. (2024), *Big G*, NBER WP.
- **Verification:** ✅ **Verified.**
    - Standard stylized facts from the paper.
