This paper revisits the New Keynesian framework, theoretically and quantitatively,
in an economy with multiple sectors and input-output linkages. Analytical expressions
for the Phillips curve and welfare, derived as a function of primitives, show that the
slope of all sectoral and aggregate Phillips curves is decreasing in intermediate in-
put shares, while productivity ﬂuctuations endogenously generate an inﬂation-output
tradeoff—except when inﬂation is measured according to the novel divine coincidence
index. Consistent with the theory, the divine coincidence index provides a better ﬁt
in Phillips curve regressions than consumer prices. Monetary policy can no longer
achieve the ﬁrst-best, resulting in a welfare loss of 2.9% of per-period GDP under the
constrained-optimal policy, which increases to 3.8% when targeting consumer inﬂation.
The constrained-optimal policy must tolerate relative price distortions across ﬁrms and
sectors in order to stabilize the output gap, and it can be implemented via a Taylor rule
that targets the divine coincidence index.

1. INTRODUCTION
THE NEW KEYNESIAN FRAMEWORK PROVIDES THE THEORETICAL UNDERPINNING of
modern monetary policy. Yet, the workhorse version of this framework rests on a simpli-
ﬁed representation of production, with only one industry and no intermediate inputs. In
reality, production happens across multiple sectors, which buy intermediate inputs from
each other and sell to ﬁnal consumers. To introduce these realistic features in the New
Keynesian framework, this paper combines it with a multi-sector model of production,
and systematically revisits its three pillars—the IS curve, the Phillips curve, and the wel-
fare function—both theoretically and quantitatively.
While the IS curve remains unaffected, the Phillips curve and the welfare function are
drastically changed, with crucial implications for monetary policy. Even when ﬂuctuations
are driven only by productivity, the central bank can no longer achieve the efﬁcient equi-
librium. Moreover, consumer price inﬂation is neither a good proxy for the output gap,
nor a good policy target. Instead, monetary policy should aim at stabilizing a novel in-
ﬂation measure—the divine coincidence index—which weights sectors according to sales
shares and price adjustment frequencies, and is a sufﬁcient statistic for the output gap.

The multi-sector model, introduced in Section 2, allows for an arbitrary number of in-
dustries, with general constant-returns-to-scale production functions, which take as inputs
labor and any combination of intermediate goods. As Section 3 illustrates, the new frame-
work is tractable enough that its log-linearized version can be solved analytically, while at
the same time it can be calibrated to fully match disaggregated input-output data.
Section 4 then turns to studying the Phillips curve. In multi-sector economies, one can
construct inﬂation rates and Phillips curves for every sector. Since prices across sectors are
differentially affected by changes in the output gap, the Phillips curve slopes are sector-
speciﬁc. Moreover, in sharp contrast with the one-sector benchmark, in the multi-sector
economy productivity ﬂuctuations generate a tradeoff between closing the output gap and
eliminating inﬂation, both at the sector level and in the aggregate. This tradeoff manifests
as sector-speciﬁc, productivity-driven residuals in the Phillips curves, and it affects all
inﬂation measures, except for the divine coincidence index.
The slopes of all sectoral Phillips curves get ﬂatter as producers use more intermediate
inputs, because price rigidities get compounded at each step along the production chain.
Hence, by properly accounting for input-output linkages, the multi-sector model has the
potential to reconcile relatively high micro level frequencies of price adjustment with the
ﬂat Phillips curves measured in empirical studies. Section 4 formalizes this argument,1
deriving an expression for the slope of sectoral and aggregate Phillips curves as a function
of micro level intermediate input shares and price adjustment probabilities.
A key result in the one-sector economy, often referred to as the divine coincidence,
states that productivity ﬂuctuations do not generate an inﬂation-output tradeoff, and
therefore they do not affect the residual of the Phillips curve. In the multi-sector econ-
omy, instead, productivity shocks affect the residual term of all sectoral and aggregate
Phillips curves, except the divine coincidence one. Hence, the divine coincidence index is
the unique inﬂation-based sufﬁcient statistic for the output gap, and the corresponding
empirical Phillips curve is the only well-speciﬁed one.
In the one-sector economy, the divine coincidence holds because of an equilibrating
mechanism, whereby, whenever productivity falls (increases), wages always also fall (in-
crease), mirroring the marginal product of labor. The wage response stabilizes marginal
costs, thereby offsetting any inﬂationary pressure. In economies with sticky wages or mul-
tiple sectors, however, the wage adjustment may be dampened, and industries may be
differentially exposed to wage and productivity changes. Therefore, prices rise in sectors
which suffer more from decreasing productivity than they beneﬁt from decreasing wages,
and vice versa. Section 4 analytically characterizes the effect of sectoral productivity
shocks on sectoral and aggregate inﬂation. In particular, the multi-sector model predicts
positive consumer price inﬂation whenever productivity falls in downstream industries—
which means closer to ﬁnal consumers—or in industries with more ﬂexible prices.
Having characterized the positive properties of the multi-sector model, Section 5 then
turns to welfare and optimal monetary policy. Like in the one-sector model, in multi-
sector economies too there is a welfare loss whenever employment or relative prices de-
viate from the efﬁcient level. The welfare loss function expresses the cost of employment
and price distortions in terms of the network primitives. In multi-sector economies, rela-
tive price distortions occur both within and across sectors, and cause producers and ﬁnal
consumers to inefﬁciently shift demand towards the ﬁrms and sectors whose relative price
1The argument was ﬁrst made by Basu (1995) in a simpler model, and later by Christiano (2016). Quan-
titatively, Carvalho (2006) and Nakamura and Steinsson (2013) showed that input-output linkages increase

is too low given their productivity. The demand response is governed by sectoral elastic-
ities of substitution. For within-sector distortions, the welfare cost is the same function
of sectoral inﬂation, price adjustment probabilities, and substitution elasticities as in the
one-sector model. In the multi-sector model, the welfare function further weights each
sector according to the relevant sale share. Price distortions across sectors are new to
the multi-sector model, and their welfare cost depends on the interaction between dis-
tortions originating in different sectors. Two distortions offset each other if they move
downstream prices in the same direction, because on net they produce smaller deviations
from the efﬁcient relative prices, and vice versa.
Beyond deriving the welfare loss function, Section 5 also draws the implications for
monetary policy. Given the multiple production sectors, the central bank has consider-
ably limited power, because it has only one instrument, the nominal interest rate. There-
fore, it can only move prices along one direction—parallel to the slope of sectoral Phillips
curves—which is unlikely to coincide, when there are multiple sectors, with the efﬁcient
relative price change. Moreover, given that Phillips curves are ﬂatter with input-output
linkages, the central bank must consequently move employment far away from the efﬁ-
cient level in order to affect prices. For all these reasons, in the multi-sector economy
monetary policy should focus on closing the output gap. Nonetheless, this does not mean
the end of inﬂation targeting, because, as Section 5 demonstrates, the central bank can
close the output gap at all periods by replacing consumer price inﬂation with the divine
coincidence index in the Taylor rule. However, since it cannot correct relative prices, the
central bank must tolerate a welfare loss.
Having elaborated the theoretical aspects in Sections 4 and 5, Sections 6 and 7 explore
the empirical properties of the multi-sector framework. Section 6 calibrates the multi-
sector model to the U.S. input-output data. By properly accounting for intermediate in-
put linkages and wage rigidity, in the multi-sector model the slope of the consumer price
Phillips curve is reduced by one order of magnitude, reconciling micro level measures of
price adjustment frequencies with macro level estimates. To evaluate how changes in the
input-output structure over time affected the Phillips curve, we calibrate the multi-sector
model to historical input-output data for 1947–2017. Although the slope remains one or-
der of magnitude smaller than in the one-sector benchmark throughout the whole period,
during this period it has further ﬂattened by about 30% due to growing intermediate input
ﬂows relative to labor compensation.
Section 6 also estimates the welfare loss from business cycles, when the central bank
follows alternative policy rules. In the multi-sector economy, the welfare loss is several
orders of magnitude larger than in the one-sector benchmark. It is a well-known result
that, in frictionless economies, the welfare loss from business cycles is tiny—about 005%
of per-period GDP according to the famous Lucas (1977) estimate. Moreover, in the
one-sector New Keynesian model, welfare is the same as in the frictionless economy,
because monetary policy can replicate the efﬁcient equilibrium. By contrast, in the multi-
sector economy the central bank cannot eliminate relative price distortions—even when it
adopts the optimal policy—leading to an average loss of 29% of per-period GDP relative
to the efﬁcient ﬂex-price equilibrium. If instead the central bank targets consumer prices,
the welfare loss increases to 38% of per-period GDP.
Finally, Section 7 compares Phillips curve estimates for the divine coincidence index
and several common measures of consumer price inﬂation (the CPI, the PCE, and their
core versions), based on time series data for sector-level inﬂation. As predicted by the
theoretical model, the divine coincidence speciﬁcation outperforms all consumer price
speciﬁcations over the sample period 1984–2018, in several dimensions. First, the divine
1420
ELISA RUBBO
coincidence speciﬁcation yields a two to four times larger R-squared than the consumer
price speciﬁcations. Second, estimated in 20-year rolling regressions, the Phillips curve
slope always has the correct sign, and it is signiﬁcant and stable over time. By contrast,
when using the consumer price speciﬁcations, the slope is often insigniﬁcant and has the
wrong sign. Both results are consistent with the model prediction that the divine coinci-
dence index is more robustly correlated with the output gap, because it does not suffer
from productivity-driven cost-push shocks.

1.1. Related Literature
The framework in this paper builds on Baqaee and Farhi (2019, 2020b),2 who studied
the implications of exogenous markups in input-output models. Compared to Baqaee
and Farhi (2020b), this paper further characterizes the endogenous evolution of sectoral
markups determined by price rigidities, and the consequent inﬂation response.
In previous work on monetary policy in multi-sector economies, researchers focused on
either small-scale analytical models (Gali (2015), Woodford (2003), Gali and Monacelli
(2008), Kara (2009, 2010)), or on large-scale quantitative models (Carvalho (2006), Car-
valho and Nechio (2011), Cagliarini, Robinson, and Tran (2011), Nakamura and Steinsson
(2013), Pasten, Schoenle, and Weber (2017), Pasten, Schoenle, and Weber (2019), Castro
Cienfuegos (2019), Hoynck (2020), Ghassibe (2021)). The current paper combines the
two approaches by revisiting and extending previous analytical results in a quantitatively
realistic production network. This allows us to formalize in a general network the insight
that input-output linkages ﬂatten the Phillips curve (Basu (1995), Christiano (2016)), ex-
pressing sectoral and aggregate slopes in terms of micro level input-output data and price
adjustment frequencies. Moreover, our approach allows us to provide analytical expres-
sions for the cost-push shocks which affect sectoral Phillips curves as a result of changes
in productivity. Building on this novel result, we can construct the divine coincidence in-
ﬂation index and show that it is a better sufﬁcient statistic for the output gap.
Discussing the optimal monetary policy, Section 5 below generalizes previous results
from New Keynesian models with two sectors or wage rigidities (Erceg, Henderson, and
Levin (2000), Blanchard and Gali (2007)), and it thus conﬁrms that consumer prices are a
suboptimal policy target in multi-sector economies (Aoki (2001), Benigno (2004), Huang
and Liu (2005)). Our general approach allows us to establish that the output gap is always
a nearly optimal policy target, regardless of the network structure. Moreover, our ap-
proach demonstrates that one can always stabilize the output gap by targeting the divine
coincidence inﬂation index. Compared to previous quantitative studies of the optimal
inﬂation target (Mankiw and Reis (2003), Eusepi, Hobijn, and Tambalotti (2011)), this
paper characterizes analytically the weighting scheme for the divine coincidence index,
showing that it does not depend directly on micro level input-output shares, but only on
sectoral sales shares and price adjustment frequencies.
In parallel and independent work, La’O and Tahbaz-Salehi (2019) also studied optimal
monetary policy in multi-sector economies with an input-output network. This paper dif-
fers from La’O and Tahbaz-Salehi (2019) in two main dimensions. First, while La’O and
Tahbaz-Salehi (2019) focused only on optimal policy, this paper discusses the Phillips

curve as well.3 Second, La’O and Tahbaz-Salehi (2019) microfounded price rigidities
as arising from incomplete information, and characterized information structures under
which monetary policy can replicate the efﬁcient equilibrium. These results complement
the analysis in the current paper, which adopts the Calvo model. Our modeling of price
rigidities is more restrictive, but it allows us to work with a dynamic multi-period model.
Other studies have also considered New Keynesian economies with heterogeneous
ﬁrms, focusing on different elements than those emphasized in this paper. Baqaee and
Farhi (2020a) introduced downward nominal wage rigidity, and studied its interaction
with sector-speciﬁc supply and demand shocks. Baqaee, Farhi, and Sangani (2021) in-
stead showed that, when allowing for non-CES demand, monetary shocks have ﬁrst-order
effects on allocative efﬁciency.
A large empirical literature has documented the shortcomings of consumer price in-
ﬂation in Phillips curve regressions and forecasting (Orphanides and van Norden (2002),
Mavroeidis, Plagborg-Moller, and Stock (2014)), and has sought to construct indicators
with better statistical properties (Stock and Watson (1999), Bernanke and Boivin (2003),
Stock and Watson (2016)). This paper shows that replacing consumer prices with the di-
vine coincidence index improves the ﬁt of Phillips curve regressions, yielding stable and
signiﬁcant estimates over time and across speciﬁcations.

the elasticities of substitution between inputs in production and between consumption goods.

Abstract
We study optimal fiscal and monetary policy in multi-sector, input-output
economies with nominal rigidities and a rich set of tax instruments. Irrespective
of the network structure, with N>1 sectors, production efficiency can be achieved
with 2N state-contingent, sector-specific tax instruments. The optimal tax scheme
involves jointly stabilizing all prices set by sellers while generating efficient move-
ments in after-tax prices faced by buyers. Optimal fiscal and monetary policy are
independent of the vector of price rigidities; optimal sector-specific tax rates are
moreover independent of the availability of lump-sum taxes. We provide several tax
equivalences and non-equivalences.
Keywords: fiscal policy, monetary policy, production efficiency, production net-
works, misallocation.

Introduction
In multi-sector, input-output economies with nominal rigidities, the first best allocation
is generically unattainable with monetary policy alone (Aoki, 2001; Woodford, 2003b,
2010; La’O and Tahbaz-Salehi, 2022). Even when shocks are exclusively technological,
as long as tax instruments are non-state-contingent, monetary policy can attain at most
a “third-best” allocation: one that features production inefficiency and an endogenous,
state-contingent labor wedge (La’O and Tahbaz-Salehi, 2022; Rubbo, 2023). Optimal
monetary policy in multi-sector economies thereby contrasts sharply to its one-sector
counterpart: in the standard New Keynesian (NK) model with technology shocks, the
first best is achievable with price level stabilization and a constant sales subsidy.
From this observation one might conclude that there are “missing” tax instru-
ments in the multi-sector, input-output NK framework. Indeed, it is clear that a state-
contingent labor income or consumption tax could eliminate the state-contingent labor
wedge. It is less clear, however, what tax instruments would restore production effi-
ciency. The heart of the problem is the following. In this class of models, monetary pol-
icy can target at most one price index. But with sector-specific technology shocks and
nominal rigidities, no price index can eliminate misallocation both within and across
sectors. To this end, finer-tuned fiscal instruments appear necessary.
But what instruments? And in what manner should they to be used? We address
these questions in this paper. Within a broad class of multi-sector NK models with
input-output linkages, and allowing for a rich set of fiscal instruments, we jointly char-
acterize optimal monetary and fiscal policy. Our main result is to demonstrate how dis-
tortionary taxation can be used to restore production efficiency and thereby circumvent
the problem faced by monetary policy. The tax scheme we engineer involves jointly sta-
bilizing all prices set by sellers while generating efficient movements in after-tax prices
faced by buyers.
In any environment with nominal rigidities, fiscal and monetary policy interact:
the efficacy and optimality of monetary policy depend on the details of fiscal policy.
The contribution of this paper is to thereby establish the theoretical benchmark of
sufficiently rich fiscal instruments within the class of multi-sector, input-output NK
economies. Our benchmark differs markedly from—and, in fact, constitutes the polar
opposite of—the standard benchmark of “inactive” fiscal policy in which subsidies are
used only to eliminate steady-state markups. As argued above, the distance between the
two benchmarks is small to non-existent in the one-sector NK framework but widens
with multiple sectors and intermediate good trade. Recent papers consider environ-
ments in the interior of this gap.
Prior to studying monetary policy in environments featuring restricted sets of “ac-
1
tive” fiscal instruments, it would be useful to first understand the sufficiently rich fiscal
instruments benchmark. What are the missing fiscal tools that restricted sets may or
may not compensate for? Answering this question, characterizing these instruments,
and establishing this benchmark is what we do in this paper.
The Model and Results. Firms are linked to one another via an input-output network.
They produce goods using labor, capital, and intermediate inputs and are subject to
industry-level productivity shocks, demand shocks, and shocks to elasticities of substi-
tution (or markups). Following the NK framework, firms set prices and face Calvo price
rigidities; we allow the Calvo parameter to vary by sector. A representative household
consumes the final good, supplies labor, saves, and invests in capital. A government
finances exogenous public expenditure and sets fiscal and monetary policy jointly.
We take the standard Ramsey approach and assume the government has access to
a rich set of distortionary, linear tax instruments—including multiple types of sector-
specific, state-contingent tax rates—but cannot raise money with lump-sum taxation.
The latter restriction on fiscal instruments implies that full efficiency, i.e. the “first best,”
cannot be achieved; we later relax this restriction in an extension.
Our main analysis centers on implementation of the Ramsey optimum, which in our
economy coincides with the canonical Lucas and Stokey (1983) benchmark. We focus
on the Ramsey optimum for the following reason: this benchmark exhibits production
efficiency in the sense of Diamond and Mirrlees (1971); see Chari and Kehoe (1999).
Implementation of the Ramsey optimum therefore demonstrates how a sufficiently rich
set of fiscal instruments can restore production efficiency in this class of economies.
Our main theorem characterizes monetary and fiscal policy that jointly implement
the Ramsey optimum. Without loss of generality, we focus on implementations in which
monetary policy stabilizes the final good price level. Our characterization of optimal
fiscal policy yields the following six lessons:
1. The optimal tax structure achieves production efficiency. In order to do so, sector-
specific tax rates play two roles: they stabilize seller prices and generate efficient
fluctuations in after-tax prices.
2. Optimal sector-specific tax rates are state-contingent. They depend on the real-
ized nominal wage, sectoral technologies, and sectoral elasticities of substitution,
but they do not depend on sectoral demand shocks and government spending.
Optimal monetary and fiscal policy are invariant to the vector of price rigidities.
3. Regardless of the network structure, with N sectors production efficiency can be
attained with 2N sector-specific tax instruments: N sales taxes levied on sellers
and N sales taxes levied on buyers. Unlike in standard models with price flexibil-
2
ity, taxes levied on sellers and on buyers when sellers face price rigidities are not
equivalent.
4. Sector-specific input taxes on labor, capital, and intermediate goods can substi-
tute for the seller-imposed sales taxes. In this implementation, intermediate good
input taxes are destination-specific but not origin-specific.
5. Sector-specific intermediate good and final good taxes can substitute for the
buyer-imposed sales taxes. In this implementation, intermediate good input taxes
are origin-specific but not destination-specific.
6. Optimal sector-specific tax rates are independent of the availability of lump-sum
taxes.
What roles do the sector-specific tax instruments play in restoring production effi-
ciency? Lesson 1 answers this question. Production efficiency requires no misalloca-
tion within and across sectors—a goal unattainable with monetary policy alone. The
tax scheme we engineer involves jointly stabilizing seller prices while simultaneously
generating efficient movements in after-tax prices faced by buyers. This tax scheme
eliminates misallocation within and across sectors, ensuring efficient production of the
final good.
These dual roles require tax state-contingency. Lesson 2 tells us what dimensions of
the state space the optimal sector-specific taxes are contingent upon. It also answers
the more practical question of what information is needed by the fiscal authority in
order to administer such taxes. We find that the optimal tax rates are contingent on
realized marginal costs and elasticities of substitution or, more generally, desired mark-
ups. While this is arguably a heavy information burden for the fiscal authority, what is
perhaps more surprising are the dimensions of the state space the optimal tax rates are
not contingent upon. Conditional on realized marginal costs, sector-specific tax rates
are independent of sector-specific demand and government spending.
We find that for any implementation of the Ramsey optimum, tax rates are inde-
pendent of the vector of sectoral price rigidities (Calvo parameters). The irrelevance
of sectoral price rigidities for optimal fiscal and monetary policy, even when the opti-
mal allocation does not coincide with the first best, generalizes previously-established
results by Correia, Nicolini and Teles (2008) to multi-sector NK economies with input-
output linkages.
Lessons 1 and 2 are general in that they apply to all implementations of the Ramsey
optimum. Moving on, we explore specific tax implementations. The first is the “least
instruments” implementation: we show that, irrespective of the input-output structure,
3
with N>1 sectors and two roles for taxes, 2N sector-specific taxes can implement the
Ramsey optimum (Lesson 3). This implementation requires N sales taxes levied on
sellers and N sales taxes levied on buyers. We thus exploit a non-equivalence between
sales taxes collected on sellers and on buyers when sellers face nominal rigidities, as
highlighted by Poterba, Rotemberg and Summers (1986).
Despite this particular tax non-equivalence, we present two more implementations
that showcase two different tax equivalences. In the first, we assume that the seller-
imposed sales tax is unavailable.
The Ramsey optimum can still be implemented:
sector-specific taxes on labor, capital, and intermediate good inputs can substitute for
the missing seller-imposed sales tax (Lesson 4). In the second, we assume that the
buyer-imposed sales tax instrument is unavailable. The Ramsey optimum can again
be implemented: sector-specific intermediate good and final good taxes can substitute
for the missing buyer-imposed sales tax (Lesson 5).
Whether or not the first-best is attainable depends on the availability of lump-sum
tax instruments. A question arises as to whether the availability of lump-sum taxa-
tion alters the optimal sector-specific tax instruments. We show that the answer is no:
whether or not the Ramsey optimum coincides with the first-best changes only the op-
timal aggregate tax rates—it has no effect on the optimal sector-specific tax rates (Les-
son 6). The irrelevance of lump-sum taxation for the optimal sector-specific tax rates
drives home the point that their main function is to restore within-period production
efficiency.
Related literature. This paper demonstrates how a rich set of distortionary tax instru-
ments can be used to implement the Ramsey optimum and completely circumvent the
problem faced by monetary policy. In this sense, our paper is closest in spirit to Correia,
Nicolini and Teles (2008) and Correia, Farhi, Nicolini and Teles (2013). Our contribution
vis-`a-vis their work is to extend this insight to multi-sector, input-output NK economies
and, specifically, to characterize within this class of models the sector-level tax rates that
attain production efficiency.
Our results apply to a broad class of multi-sector NK models with or without input-
output linkages. Our framework is fairly general in that it can flexibly nest the economic
environments found in Erceg, Henderson and Levin (2000); Aoki (2001); Mankiw and
Reis (2003); Benigno (2004); Huang and Liu (2005); Woodford (2010); Eusepi, Hobijn and
