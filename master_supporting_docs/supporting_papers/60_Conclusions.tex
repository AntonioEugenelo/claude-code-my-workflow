\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}
PRELIMINARY
This paper highlights the critical role of international production networks in shaping the macroeconomic impact of tariffs. 

Using a multi-country New Keynesian model with rich sectoral heterogeneity and input-output linkages, we show that production networks significantly amplify inflation through a feedback loop between rising selling prices and production costs. The interaction between national and international networks intensifies inflationary pressures, with cross-border spillovers further magnifying the impact of tariffs. 

Our framework is well-suited for analyzing the macroeconomic impact of tariffs characterized by a high degree of sectoral and country heterogeneity. On the modeling side, further progress can be made by XXXXs.
