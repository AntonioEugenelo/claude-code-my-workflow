\section{General Model}\label{sec:general_model}
We consider a world economy composed of $K$ countries, indexed by $k$. The core of our model is a production structure characterized by national and international production networks through input-output (IO) linkages. Namely, each country is comprised of $I$ production sectors, possibly heterogeneous within and between countries. Within each sector, there is a unit mass of monopolistically competitive firms indexed by $f\in(0,1)$ that produce using labor and intermediate goods produced by other domestic and foreign sectors. In addition, we allow for heterogeneous nominal price rigidities at the sectoral and country levels.
